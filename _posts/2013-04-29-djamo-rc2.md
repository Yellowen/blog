Second release candidate of [Djamo](http://djamo.yellowen.com] is out. It's available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/).
[Djamo](http://djamo.yellowen.com) is another [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) driver (ORM-like driver) which I was working on.
It's very easy to use and have very flexible approach to data management that is more like the way **MongoDB** works, unlike other ORM-like
drivers that try to be more like  ORMs of an RDMS by providing an API close to some ORMs.

For example take a look at [Mongo Engine](http://mongoengine.org/) (I respect Mongo Engine and other softwares in this field and those who
contribute to them).
I wasn't happy with this kind of drivers and I decided to build a new one to fit our needs. After spending a week in testing
[Djamo](http://djamo.yellowen.com), I found some serializers related bugs and fixed them. One of the bugs was about a limitationin
Djamo that i wasn't aware of. So after I fixed the bug I added a document page to Djamo's Documentations [http://pythonhosted.org/Djamo/](http://pythonhosted.org/Djamo/) about its limitations.
Its natural for each software to have some limitations. I want our users to be aware of these limitations and use [Djamo](http://djamo.yellowen.com) in the best way.
