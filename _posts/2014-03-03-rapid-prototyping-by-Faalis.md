description: Create web application in a blink using Ruby on Rails and Faalis
---
If you are familiar with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) or use it, you are my audience. There is some boring tasks in each web application which you have
to take care of even if you don't like it. For example: creating an authentication and authorization system, creating an administration interface,
creating a RESTful api and ... .You may re-implement these systems each time in every project of yours. Isn't it a bit boring and troublesome ?

In software engineering team of [Yellowen Inc](http://www.Yellowen.com) we develop a free gem called **[Faalis](http://github.com/Yellowen/Faalis)**
which do all these jobs and more for you and allow rapid and painless development on **Ruby on Rails**. In addition to implementing useful system,
we create a unique dashboard for administration base on [Angularjs](http://angularjs.org) with some powerful code generator that make life much easier. A simple generator
will generate a RESTful api, admin interface views and resource permissions. Also it take care of complex relationships between resources with an easy
to extend UI.

**Faalis** is still very young and under a heavy development process. I encourage all of you to join us to have fun development together.
