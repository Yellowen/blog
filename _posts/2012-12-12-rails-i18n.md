I never created any multi-language web application using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), But about a month ago I have to
use the [Rails i18n system](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html) with one of my projects. I had the basic knowledge about how Rails
i18n works.

After spending a few hours reading and working with Rails i18n I found it very **Hard and annoying** to work with.
For example you have to put any strings you want to translate into your language file (fa.yml for example) manually.
I don't like it. In compare to [Django](http://djangoproject.com/) which use [GNU Gettext](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/), this
approach is not good at all.

One of the features of i18n system of **Django** (gettext) which I find really handy and cool is its string collecting (this is a gettext
feature originally).

Unfortunately **Rails** i18n system does not implement such simple feature.

> **NOTE**:
> There is some gems which do the trick for you or you can write some `rake` tasks

So I searched the web about this problem and I found some solutions. The best solution I found was using
[fast_gettext](https://github.com/grosser/fast_gettext) and [gettext i18n rails](https://github.com/grosser/gettext_i18n_rails) gems. Using these gems you will achieve a fast (according to **fast gettext** benchmark data, it's 3.5x faster than Rails i18n) and flexible i18n system.
Take look at their project pages for installationand usage introduction.
