If you are a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) guru, you already are familiar with [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip).
But if you're not, you gonna love this.

[Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) is a wonderful gem which provide an easy file attachment support to **Active Record**.
Its very easy to use, flexible and well documented with lots of interesting features likes image processing (cropping, resizing, make
thumbnails and pretty much what ever [Imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) can do), video processing and storage backends (file, S3,
dropbox etc). Take a look at [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/wiki) page of Paperclips for more details on features.

It only took about 5 minutes for me to deploy **Paperclip** in my project. It really made working with attachments and images very easy. Kudos to
people behind this awesome gem who done hell of a job.
